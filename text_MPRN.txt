Hello! My name is Maria Rodriguez and I am from Colombia. One of my favorite quotes is by Stephen Chbosky: "This moment will just be another story someday." It conveys the fleeting nature of life. Both the good and the bad moments will eventually become memories.

When it comes to food, I usually enjoy every kind. However, I recently had the opportunity to try "Trippa," which is made from the edible lining of ruminants' stomachs, mainly cows. Despite liking its flavor, I couldn't finish it due to its texture.

I love ice cream! If you ever have the chance to visit Colombia, I highly recommend trying the ice cream at "Crepes & Waffles." And if you're closer to Roma, there's an excellent gelato place called "Gelateria Sweet Life" where the owner puts in a lot of effort to create amazing flavors.

Lastly, if you're on the lookout for a salad dressing recipe, it might interest you to know that the German word for vinegar is "essig"
